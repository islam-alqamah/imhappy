- [Single Database](#section-1)

Multi-tenant architectures are the industry standard for enterprise SaaS applications, it is a good choice for businesses that want to get started with fewer hardware requirements and easier onboarding. It is also ideal for customers who donâ€™t have the internal resources needed to handle the maintenance requirements of single tenant SaaS environments.

### Single Database Multi-tenancy

When using the "single database" version, data from all tenants will be gathered into a single database and separated by columns containing tenantID's.

SaasWeb using this approach and Tenant relationships are handled automatically.

### Model setup
If your models are somehow limited to the current team you will find yourself writing this query over and over again: 
```php 
Model::where('team_id', auth()->user()->currentTeam->id)->get();
```
> {info} This assumes that the model has a field called `team_id`.

```php 
use App\Traits\UsedByTeams;

class Task extends Model
{
    use UsedByTeams;
}
```
### Tenants CRUD Operations
By adding `UsedByTeams` trait on a model. you can now call CRUD operations directly.

```php 
// gets all tasks for the currently active team of the authenticated user
Task::all();
```
### Normal CRUD Operations
SaaSWeb gives you ability to fetch data to perform normal CRUD operations on models with `UsedByTeams` trait.
To do so, you can use `allTeams` scope when fetching records associated with that model.

> {warning} For example this operations can be done on: admin dashboard.

```php 
// gets all tasks from all teams globally
Task::allTeams()->get();
```
